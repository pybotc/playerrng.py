PlayerRNG.py is inspired by haz3mn's "player rng ðŸŽ²" https://www.roblox.com/games/16953799253/player-rng-testing.
When you first open up the game, it mentions the control of the game, "Roll" and "Save", You could also exit by typing in "exit".

When you type in roll, the script will automatically bring in a random player from roblox, then check it rarities using a star system similar to "player rng ðŸŽ²".

When you find a *kewl* account that you want to save, just type in save, and it would automatically be saved in the "Saved Accounts" folder.
